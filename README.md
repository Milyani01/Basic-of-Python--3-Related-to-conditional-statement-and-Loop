# Questions Related to Conditional Expression 

1. Write a program that takes a number as input and prints whether it's positive, negative, or zero.
2. Create a program that takes two numbers as input and prints the larger one.
3. Write a program that checks if a given number is odd or even.
4. Create a program that takes a single alphabet as input and prints whether it's a vowel or a consonant.
5. Create a program that takes a person's age as input and prints whether they are a child, teenager, adult, or senior.
6. Simulate a traffic light. Take the color as input and print whether it's safe to go, slow down, or stop.
7. Create a program that takes a student's score as input and prints their corresponding grade. Use the standard grading scale (A, B, C, D, F).
8. Write a program that checks whether a given year is a leap year or not. A leap year is divisible by 4, except for years that are divisible by 100. However, years divisible by 400 are leap 
   years.
9. Write a function that checks whether a given word or phrase is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).
10. Develop a program that calculates the cost of movie tickets based on the age of the viewer. The prices are as follows:
    Children (0-12): $5

    Teens (13-17): $8

     Adults (18-64): $12

     Seniors (65 and above): $7

# Questions Related to For Loop

1. Use a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.
2. Calculate and print the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to 5 using a for loop.
3. Write a program that takes a number as input and prints the first 5 multiples of that number using a for loop.
4. Take a number as input and use a for loop to print the multiplication table for that number from 1 to 10.
5. Develop a Python program that checks whether a given number is prime or not using a for loop.
6. Create a Python program to find the largest element in a list using a for loop.
7. Write a Python program to reverse a given string using a for loop.
8. Develop a Python program that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 using a for loop.
9. Write a Python program to find the factorial of a number using a for loop

# Questions Related to While Loop

1. Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
2. Create a program that asks the user to enter a number and then prints the multiplication table of that number using a while loop.
3. Develop a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a while loop.
4. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a series of numbers until they enter a negative number. Then, the program should print the sum of all the positive numbers entered.
5. Implement a simple guessing game where the program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess the number. The program should provide hints (higher/lower) until 
   the user guesses the correct number, using a while loop.
6. Create a program that prompts the user to enter a password. Keep asking for the password until the user enters the correct password "password123". Once the correct password is entered, 
    print a success message.
